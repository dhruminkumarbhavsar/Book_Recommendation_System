# Book_Recommendation_System
# Objective
The goal of this project was to develop a personalized Book Recommendation System that helps users discover books based on their preferences. The system aimed to enhance user experience by leveraging machine learning techniques and data-driven recommendations.

**Technologies Used**
 **Frontend Development**:
React.js / Vue.js – Built a dynamic and user-friendly interface.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Designed an intuitive and responsive UI.
API Integration – Connected frontend with backend to display recommendations.
**Backend & Data Engineering**:
Flask / Django – Developed APIs to handle book recommendations.
MySQL / MongoDB – Stored book data, user interactions, and preferences.
BeautifulSoup / Scrapy – Collected book details through web scraping.
**Machine Learning & Recommendation Algorithms**:
Collaborative Filtering – Suggested books based on user preferences.
Content-Based Filtering – Recommended books similar to the user’s past choices.
Hybrid Approach – Combined both techniques for improved accuracy.
Scikit-Learn & Pandas – Used for data processing and model implementation.
# Features & Functionality
 Personalized Book Recommendations – Based on user preferences and history.
 Search & Filter Options – Users can search books by genre, author, and rating.
 User Ratings & Reviews – Stored user interactions to improve recommendations.
 Interactive UI – Responsive and intuitive frontend design.
 Real-time Data Processing – Optimized queries for faster recommendation retrieval.

My Role in the Project
As a Frontend Developer & Data Engineer, my responsibilities included:
 Data Collection & Preprocessing: Scraped, cleaned, and structured book data for analysis.
 Database Management: Designed and optimized MySQL/MongoDB schemas for fast queries.
 Frontend Development: Built a React.js/Vue.js interface for seamless user interaction.
 API Integration: Connected frontend with backend recommendation models.

Project Outcomes & Impact
Enhanced User Experience – Users received accurate book recommendations.
Optimized Query Performance – Fast retrieval of book data and recommendations.
Increased Engagement – Improved discoverability of books through smart filtering.

Future Enhancements:

Implement Neural Collaborative Filtering (Deep Learning) for better recommendations.
Deploy the system on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP) for scalability.
Introduce user authentication & personalized dashboards for enhanced experience.
